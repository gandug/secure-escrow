The **Secure Escrow Smart Contract** is a Clarity-based smart contract on the Stacks blockchain that facilitates trustless transactions between parties. The contract ensures funds are securely held in escrow until predefined conditions are met, such as service completion, product delivery, or mutual agreement.

## Features
- **Trustless Fund Holding:** Funds are locked in escrow until conditions are satisfied.
- **Multi-Signature Approvals:** Supports third-party arbitration for dispute resolution.
- **Automated Refunds:** Time-based expiration allows automatic refunds if conditions are unmet.
- **On-Chain Transparency:** All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain.
